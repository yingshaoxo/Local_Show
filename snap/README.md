# snapcraft

I think snapcraft is trying to do something android or google play store did

They let you specify app permissions first, then cut permission one by one. I mean they will only allow you to use graphs in the end.

If you use other permissions other than audio and graphs, they will not publish your application

And in the end, they will even remove some functions from linux kernel level

If you know google play app development, you would know what I am trying to say

> By the way, snapcraft will auto update your applications without notify you. And it can't get turned down.
